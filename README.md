# Data Analysis of Aviation Accident Database & Synopses, up to 2023
## Introduction
In this project we will analyse data that includes: aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters, from the National Transportation Safety Board.

This analysis is useful for the purchasing of aircrafts, in order to tailor to the expectations of a particular business.

## Objectives

- Understand the datadet.
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Analyse the severity of the accident.
- Identify the most common causes of accidents.
- Assess accident trends over time.
- Examine accident distribution by aircraft type, operator, and region.

## Business Understanding
### Which aircraft models present the lowest safety risks, based on historical aviation accident data?

This analysis will guide decisions regarding the purchasing of aircrafts for the companyâ€™s new aviation division, helping make logical investments, minimize operational and liability risks from the beginning. Through identifying low-risk aircraft models based on real accident history.

## Data Understanding
The data sources for this analysis will be pulled from :

_AviationData.csv_

- Source: This data comes from the National Transportation Safety Board.
- Content: The NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories and possessions, and in international waters.
- Format: This is a csv file, each row represents one aviation accident and each columns contains different types of information regarding the flight.

## Requirements
1. A list of aircraft with the lowest accident/fatality rates.
2. Visualizations of safety trends and summaries.
3. Business-ready recommendations for safe investment.

The aviation accident dataset provides insightful, multi-dimensional data that will support identifying low-risk aircraft models for use specifically for the company. Understanding the structure, completeness, and key attributes of this data is essential to producing reliable and actionable safety insights for strategic aircraft procurement.


## Summary
Based on the analysis conducted to support the company's entry into the aviation sector,
I would suggest the Sikorsky models(MH-60R,UH-60A), AB SPORTINE AVIACIJA GENESIS 2 
and the Zenith aircraft for initial purchase.
These models have shown relatively low involvement in accidents.

I strongly advise  against purchasing Cessna aircraft models.
While their high accident rate may partly reflect it's popularity,
the potential risk they present outweighs the benefits,
especially for a company making its first investment in aviation.

In terms of the engine, the UNK, Hybrid Rocket and the Electric would be the safest options.
However, if there are any budget constraints purchase of the electric engine should be avoided
and the former engines prioritized as the more cost-effective and reliable choices.
